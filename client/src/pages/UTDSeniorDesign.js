                Every year, Computer Science students at UTD participate in a
                project for the Senior Design class. These projects are created
                by companies that are interested in the program. For my project,
                I worked with a team to design a website for UTDâ€™s Senior Design
                class. Our team's objective was to create a central website
                where students, faculty, and sponsors have easy access to all
                the information they need. Students will be able to form groups,
                submit weekly reports, and view project information. Sponsors
                will submit proposals and accompanying attachments, and faculty
                and mentors will be able to oversee and keep track of student
                progress and weekly reports. To do this we will be creating a
                web front-end with ReactJS that will provide users easy access
                to all information they need. The front-end will communicate
                with a SQL database, made using MySQL, and a Node.JS back-end.
                The resulting product will be a fully functioning secure website
                where students, faculty, and sponsors can access all the
                information they need to stay updated on their projects.

                Prior to this project, students were submitting any required
                documentation through the elearning site. Teams also submitted a
                completely different form, which included the group members, and
                their preferred project choices. In addition to this, the
                provided project list and project information slides were
                located in two different sites. This was a very unorganized way
                to gather team information.

                Our group's solution for this problem was to create a central
                site that students, faculty, and company sponsors will be able
                to log into and access all this information, so that it is both
                readily available and easily accessible. Students can use the
                student portal to join and form teams and edit them. Similarly
                to students, the company portal will allow companies to submit
                their project proposals, specify their requirements, and contact
                the faculty when necessary. Faculty will have administrative
                access and will be able to view all groups, their team members,
                and their assigned projects and can make changes as they see
                fit. As a result all three entities will be able to easily
                access all the information they need regarding the projects.

                For this project, I was part of the front end team. We started
                by planning out the initial design of the website. One of our
                main priorities was to create a simple interface. Once we had
                the design planned, we started to explore React and Javascript.
                To design the website, we worked with ReactJS and Material UI.
