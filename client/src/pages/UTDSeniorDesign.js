            Every year, Computer Science students at UTD participate in a
            project for the Senior Design class. These projects are created by
            companies that are interested in the program. For my project, I
            worked with a team to design a website for UTDâ€™s Senior Design
            class. Our team's objective was to create a central website where
            students, faculty, and sponsors have easy access to all the
            information they need. Students will be able to form groups, submit
            weekly reports, and view project information. Sponsors will submit
            proposals and accompanying attachments, and faculty and mentors will
            be able to oversee and keep track of student progress and weekly
            reports. To do this we will be creating a web front-end with ReactJS
            that will provide users easy access to all information they need.
            The front-end will communicate with a SQL database, made using
            MySQL, and a Node.JS back-end. The resulting product will be a fully
            functioning secure website where students, faculty, and sponsors can
            access all the information they need to stay updated on their
            projects.

            Prior to this project, students were submitting any required
            documentation through the elearning site. Teams also submitted a
            completely different form, which included the group members, and
            their preferred project choices. In addition to this, the provided
            project list and project information slides were located in two
            different sites. This was a very unorganized way to gather team
            information.

            className={classes.typography}
          >
            Our group's solution for this problem was to create a central site
            that students, faculty, and company sponsors will be able to log
            into and access all this information, so that it is both readily
            available and easily accessible. Students can use the student portal
            to join and form teams and edit them. Similarly to students, the
            company portal will allow companies to submit their project
            proposals, specify their requirements, and contact the faculty when
            necessary. Faculty will have administrative access and will be able
            to view all groups, their team members, and their assigned projects
            and can make changes as they see fit. As a result all three entities
            will be able to easily access all the information they need
            regarding the projects.

            For this project, I was part of the front end team. We started by
            planning out the initial design of the website. One of our main
            priorities was to create a simple interface. Once we had the design
            planned, we started to explore React and Javascript. To design the
            website, we worked with ReactJS and Material UI.
